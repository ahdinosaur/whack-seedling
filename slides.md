# Welcome!

Wellington Hackspace

# Hi hello!

Welcome

<!--

Each person can introduce themselves:

- Name (and pronouns)
- What excited you to come?

-->

---

# What is a hackerspace?

Think a garage you share with some flatmates.

No staff, informal and somewhat chaotic.

<!--

The more common term is makerspace, however this can sometimes refer to a top-down institution-backed space, not a bottom-up member-backed space.

-->

---

# What is a hackerspace, really?

Think an incorporated society with members.

Members pay weekly dues which pays for renting a space.

Members donate or crowd-fund tools to use in the space.

<!--

Compare this with the Johnsonville Makerspace.

You might find similar tools, but a much different way of operating.

# Hackerspaces around the world

<img src="/hackerspaces-map.png" class="h-full flex-auto object-cover" />

<!--

New Zealand has only one, maybe two hackerspaces, in Auckland.

New Zealand does have multiple "makerspaces", but not the same.

# Example: Hackland.nz

Clean room

# Recap: Governance

Hackerspaces are usually run by do-ocracy:

Power is given to those who do.

Consent, not consensus.

<!--

But also, you have a legal structure.

In New Zealand, this would be an incorporated society.

-->

# Does that make sense?

Do you feel like you understand what a hackerspace is?

# Okay, you in?

Red pill, blue pill

<!--

Take the red pill and we make this happen, right here right now.

Take a blue pill and we can reset.

# Wellington Hackspace Incorporated

Let's make the legal structure.

Constitution: TODO

https://whack.nz/constitution

---

# Become a member

If you sign up, you are committing to pay $30 per week.

Sign-up form: TODO

https://whack.nz/sign-up

<!--

While it may seem silly to pay before we have a space,

we need the money in the bank to move forward.
