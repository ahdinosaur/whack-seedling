# What is a hackerspace?

Think a garage you share with some mates.

No staff, informal and somewhat chaotic.

<!--

The more common term is makerspace, however this can sometimes refer to a commercial space, not a community space.

-->

# Hackerspaces around the world

<!--

New Zealand has only one, maybe two hackerspaces, in Auckland.

# Recap: Governance

Hackerspaces are usually run by do-ocracy:

Power is given to those who do.

Consent, not consensus.

<!--

But also, you probably have a legal structure.

# Hopper St space: downstairs

# Hopper St space: upstairs

# Okay, you in?

Red pill, blue pill

<!--

Take the red pill and we make this happen, right here right now.

Take a blue pill and we can reset.

# Wellington Hackspace Incorporated

Let's make the legal structure.

# Become a member

If you sign up, you are committing to pay $30 per week.

Sign-up form: TODO

<!--

While it may seem silly to pay before we have a space,

we need the money in the bank to move forward.
